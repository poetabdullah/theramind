        "After fine-tuning SBERT for embedding your text data, a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier** was employed for the final classification task. This CNN architecture is relatively shallow but effective for feature extraction from sequential data like sentence embeddings. It consists of two 1D Convolutional layers, each followed by a MaxPooling layer to downsample and extract dominant features. A GlobalMaxPooling layer then condenses these features into a single vector, which is fed into two dense (fully connected) layers. Dropout layers are strategically placed after the pooling and dense layers to prevent overfitting, alongside L2 regularization applied to the convolutional and dense layers, further enhancing the model's generalization capabilities. The final dense layer with a softmax activation produces the probabilities for the two classes (Mental Health and Non-Mental Health)."
